SANDI is a free, open-access software designed for oceanography and sedimentology. It can be used for two purposes: 1. to extract particles from high-resolution underwater images and 2. to extract gravels (> 1 mm) from laboratory images, in order to measure their size and shape and to derive some statistics.

***Disclaimer**: This is a beta version of the software, and it may therefore still contain a few errors or malfunctions. We welcome any suggestions for improvement.*

## 1. Suspended particles
Description yet to be inserted.

## 2. Gravel analysis
This section present a fast and easy way to measure the size and shape of rocks by detecting their contours from an image.

### 2.1. Input image
The input image should contain the rocks displayed on a white or green background (see two options later), together with a scale and a label. The image should be shot from above in order to have a good overall vision of the samples.
