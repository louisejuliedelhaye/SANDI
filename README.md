# SANDI
A free and open-source software to process particles from high-resolution underwater images and to analyze rocks from laboratory images. Designed for contour detection, measurement, and analysis. 

***Disclaimer**: this is a beta version and might still contain some errors.*

The software contains two main sections: 1. a section to analyse particles in suspension in the water column from images taken with a particle camera and 2. a section on measurements of rocks > 1 mm from images taken in laboratory conditions.

## 2. Gravel analysis
This section present a fast and easy way to measure the size and calculate shape indicators of rocks by detecting their contours from an image.
