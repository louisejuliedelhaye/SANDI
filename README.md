SANDI is a free, open-access software designed for oceanography and sedimentology. It can be used for two purposes: 1. to extract suspended particles from high-resolution underwater images and 2. to extract gravels (> 1 mm) from laboratory images, in order to measure their size and shape and to derive some statistics. Users can choose to download the full code and run the ‘main’ file, or they can download the latest release of the software as an executable, which is self-contained.

***Disclaimer**: This is a beta version of the software, and it may therefore still contain a few errors or malfunctions. We welcome any suggestions for improvement.*

## 2. Gravel analysis
This section presents a fast and easy way to measure the size and shape of rocks by detecting their contours from an image taken in a laboratory. 

### 2.1. Input image
The input image should contain the rocks displayed on a white or green background (see two options later), together with a scale and a label. The image should be shot from above in order to have a good overall vision of the samples.

### 2.2. Scale measurement
When the images in jpg are imported in the software, the user is invited to draw a line representing one centimeter on the scale shown on the picture, enabling the software to calculate the scale of the image. The accuracy of this measurement is essential for the reliability of the results that are calculated based on the measured pixel size, so we recommend drawing the line several times in order to see the variability and compare the different pixel sizes obtained. A value can be considered correct when it is measured several times.

### 2.3. Background correction: white background image

### 2.4. Contours detection
#### 2.4.1. For an image with a white background
#### 2.4.2. For an image with a green background

### 2.5. Gravel filtration
### 2.6. Statistics computation
### 2.7. Outputs
